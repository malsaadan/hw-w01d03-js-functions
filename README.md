# JS Functions HW

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. When finished, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` to your fork and submit a pull request.

## Questions

1. [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) ([watch the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtcHmiAcbZc))
    - Create a file in this repo named `rps.js`
    - Write a function that takes `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` as an argument for the user choice, then chooses `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` randomly for the computer choice, and returns whether the user `win`, `lose`, or `tie`.
    - Example: `playGame('rock') // Computer picked: paper. User picked: rock.  User lose.`
    - _**Hint:** Javascript includes a `Math.random` method._

2. Dice Roller
    - Create a file in this repo and name it `dice.js`
    - Write a function that chooses two random numbers (1-6) and returns them. It should also return the sum.
    - Example: `rollDice() // Dice rolled are 6 and 1.  Sum is 7`
    - BONUS: have your function take an argument of the # of dice to be rolled.
    - Example: `rollDice(3) // Dice rolled are 4, 2, and 7.  Sum is 13.`

3.  Research 3 string methods and describe what they are used for and how to use them.  You can find string methods here https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp

Method 1
```
Name: indexOf()
Description: The method searches for a string in a string. takes one paramter which is the string you want to find, and returns the index of it. Note: if you pass a non string value or the string wasn't found, the method will return -1.
Example using it:
str = 'Programming is fun :)';
console.log(str.indexOf('fun'));
```

Method 2
```
Name: replace()
Description: The replace method takes two parameters, the first one is the string to be replaced, and the second one is the replacing string. It will find the first occurrence of the first parameter in the string and replace it with the second parameter.
Example using it:
str = 'Hello World!';
console.log(str.replace('World', 'Mashael'));
```

Method 3
```
Name: Convert to upper and lower case (toUpperCase(), toLowerCase())
Description: The string that those two methods applied on converts the string to either upper case or lower case 
Example using it:
str = 'Hello World!';
console.log(str.toUpperCase());
console.log(str.toLowerCase());
```
